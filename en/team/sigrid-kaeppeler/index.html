<p>Sigrid Käppeler studied Electronic Engineering at the National University in Galway, Ireland,
and graduated with a M.Eng.Sc. degree in 1990. For her Master’s thesis, she developed an Apple
computer application with a graphical user interface for assembling an analogue circuit and a
programme for subsequently performing real-time circuit analysis.</p>

<p>While still a student, she also worked as a design engineer for an international
telecommunications company, developing firmware in a high-level language for mag-stripe card
reader devices.</p>

<p>After graduation, Sigrid Käppeler worked as a hardware design engineer for a medium-sized
engineering firm in Dublin, Ireland. Her responsibilities included the design of circuit
hardware at register-transfer level in telecommunications ASICs for small-scale SDH and GSM
projects.</p>

<p>In 1993, she relocated to Germany, where she worked for a global company in the hardware design
of large-scale ASICs and FPGAs for telecommunication applications using the high-level circuit
design language VHDL. Other responsibilities included the development of complex test
environments, block-level and top-level circuit verification, emulation, simulation and synthesis.</p>

<p>In 2002, Sigrid Käppeler joined Beckord &amp; Niedlich. She is a European Patent Attorney and has
extensive experience in the prosecution and defence of European and German patents.</p>

<p>Sigrid Käppeler is bilingual, with English as her native language.</p>
